# Scenario: A Simple Battle Simulation

You are going to simulate a game with two characters in a battle. The goal is to understand basic JavaScript variables and functions by calculating and applying damage during an attack.

## Instructions:

### Setting up

- Create a new script in your local repository called battle-simulation.js

### Define the Characters:

- You have two characters: an attacker and a defender.
- Each character has a name and some attributes related to their combat abilities.

### Set Up the Characters:

- The attacker has a weapon with a certain attack power.
- The defender has a shield with a certain defense power and a certain amount of health.

### Write Functions to Handle the Battle:

- You need a function to calculate the damage done by the attacker to the defender.
- You need another function to apply the calculated damage to the defender's health.

### Execute the Battle:

- Calculate the damage based on the attacker’s weapon power and the defender’s shield power.
- Apply the calculated damage to the defender and update their health.
- Print out the results of the battle.
